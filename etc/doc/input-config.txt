Input config format for GP1.

See src/main/inmgr/gp1_inmgr.h:gp1_inmgr_configure_text().

Line-oriented text.
'#' begins a line comment.
Extra whitespace is not meaningful.

The file is an array of Blocks.
Each Block begins with a one-line introducer:
  device [IDS] NAME
IDS is vendor and product in hexadecimal separated by a colon, must be exactly 9 characters.
Either ID may be zero for the default match-all behavior.
NAME is loose text used as a pattern to match the device name.
Whitespace condenses, letters are case-insensitive, '*' matches any amount of anything.
See src/io/gp1_serial.h:gp1_pattern_match() for exact syntax.
Note that NAME can't contain '#', you'll have to fudge over it with '*'.
No Block terminator; it terminates implicitly at the start of the next Block or EOF.

Within a Block, each line is a Rule:
  SRCBTNID [LO..HI] DSTBTNID
  player PLAYERID
  driver NAME
  auto

The "player" rule should only appear once per Block if at all.
This is the device's preferred assignment, in case you have multiple joysticks and want them assigned predictably.

"driver" is an optional matching criterion; "none", "any", or the input driver's name eg "evdev", "machid", "mshid".
The "none" driver matches the system keyboard.
Usually you don't want to name a driver, but you might want one config file for multiple installations, so rules for both Linux and Mac eg.

"auto" to enable automatic mapping for buttons not named here. By default, those extra buttons will be ignored.

SRCBTNID is an integer, in the driver's namespace.
"0x" prefix for hexadecimal.
This may be USB-HID Usage, or something private to the driver, and you can't distinguish those.
Drivers are encouraged to use the high bits of btnid to make HID collisions unlikely.

LO..HI are two integers, inclusive at both ends.
A source value in this range is "on".
If omitted, the runtime will infer range from the driver, that's usually what you want.

DSTBTNID is a button name, action name, button group name, or numeric VM button ID.
VM button names:
  LEFT RIGHT UP DOWN
  SOUTH WEST EAST NORTH
  L1 R1 L2 R2
  AUX1 AUX2 AUX3
Action names:
  QUIT RESET
  SUSPEND RESUME STEP_FRAME
  SCREENCAP FULLSCREEN
  LOAD_STATE SAVE_STATE
Button group names:
  HORZ VERT DPAD
  NONE
  
Action names are supplied from outside inmgr, not strictly part of the spec.
(see src/main/host/gp1_host.h)

Groups (HORZ,VERT,DPAD) declare that an input will feed multiple outputs.
LO..HI are the live-zone limits for HORZ and VERT; and the 8-value full range for DPAD.

The "NONE" group lets you explicitly ignore a button, helpful when "auto" in use.
